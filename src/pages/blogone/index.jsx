     <h1 className='MainHeading'><strong>Why to choose Geography as an optional?</strong></h1>
    <p>&nbsp; Today I will tell you 7 concrete reasons of why you must choose Geography as your optional to get your name in the final list of UPSC CSE 2023-24</p>
    <h3>1<u><strong>.Role of Geography in overall selection</strong></u></h3>

    <p>● Geography as an optional subject has the highest overlap with the entire general study syllabus and preparation</p>

<p>. ● Therefore, the scores of geography optional students are more buoyant, contributing to an extra 40-50 marks in mains as well an extra 10-20 marks in prelims.</p>

<p>● As a teacher and an aspirant as well, I have realized that no other optional provides one with the breadth of knowledge or bigger coverage along with a solution oriented approach.</p>

<p>● This in turn results into a holistic personality which gets reflected in the final selections and interview marks of the students.</p>

<p>● Now let us look at the detailed overlap and holistic coverage subject wise.</p>

<h3><u><strong>2.GS 1 comprises of Geography, Indian Society, and the the entire portion of History</strong></u></h3>

<p>● Over the period of the last 7 years, the consolidated questions from geography are around 50% in GS1.</p>

<p>● It becomes 70% when we look at the Indian Society questions which have a big overlap with Human Geography part of Optional paper 1 and Indian Human Geography of Optional Paper 2 Eg: We usually see questions from hazards, monsoon variation, water scarcity, volcanoes, earthquakes etc which are the most common topics of geography optional.</p>

<p>● So the trend analysis post 2013 shows us a higher weightage being given to environmental and geographical phenomenon which affect humans and human life across the world Eg: Climate change, Sea level Rise, Climate Justice, Climate Diplomacy, Geopolitics, Geoeconomics, Geospatial Technology, Space etc. CASE STUDY : UPSC CSE 2021 OVERLAP OF GEOGRAPHY IN GS 1 2021 2020 2019 TOTAL 185 175 175 GEOGRAPHY 115 100 90 HUMAN GEOGRAPHY 70 75 85 OVERLAP 74% 70% 70% Visible trend in last four year shows move towards global climate related issues and hazards/ disaster management/ crisis management</p>

<h3><u><strong>3.GS2 comprises of Indian Polity, Governance, Developmental Issues and International Relations</strong></u></h3>

<p>● Geography covers the entire developmental issues and social justice based topics. Eg: Poverty, Hunger,</p>

<p>● It overlaps with polity in federal structure, Panchayati raj, Federalism, Development issues to name a few ● The case studies of Geography along with spatial and temporal approach of geography helps to get better scores in GS1</p>

<p>● This is due to a solution oriented approach to answers and enriched content.

Discuss the strength and impact of AUKUS in the present scenario. (Answer in 250 words) 15 Being a generalist subject, geography has very high overlaps in gs when compared with other optionals</p>

<h3><u><strong>4. GS3: Highest overlap with almost the entire paper being covered in Economic Geography, Human Geography, and Contemporary Issues</strong></u></h3>

<p>● From Infrastructure based questions on Ports, Coastal Development to Inclusive Development, Green Energy, Clean Energy, Alternate Energy GS3 has probably the highest overlap with Optional Paper 2</p>

<p>● Therefore most of the students can easily go for an integrated preparation of GS 3 and Geography</p>

<p>● The answer quality is also higher when compared to others due to the enriched content and interlinked topics of Geography and GS3.</p>

<p>● This has lead to all geography optional students performing brilliantly in GS3 over the years 5. Geography has been a favorite subject for the science students</p>

<p>● It is no secret that geography has been the most favorite of Doctors, Engineers and Science graduates</p>

<p>● The logical and practical approach of geography makes it a natural favorite for students of scientific bent</p>

<p>● The focus on conceptual understanding and conceptual clarity decreases the bulk of rote learning and works more on application rather than mere reproduction of facts.</p>

<p>● The use of maps, vialization, data and diagrams also helps in overall answer writing and getting superior scores.</p>

<h3><u><strong>6. Highest number of students who write mains are from geography year after year</strong></u></h3>

<p>● This proves the higher coverage, result as well as the appeal of the subject</p>

<p>● Geography is therefore the favorite of students who have very less exposure to arts based subject or are coming to UPSC preparation after a graduation in Sciences, Engineering or Medicine</p>

<h3><u><strong>7. Improved answer writing</strong></u></h3>

<p>● Answer writing is the most ignored aspect in UPSC preparation, however it plays the most fundamental role in getting the final selection and one&rsquo; name in the final list</p>

<p>● We often see that special classes are conducted for answer writing.</p>

<p>● However, in case of geography students, the art of note making as well as crisp and concise answer writing comes naturally in the first half of the preparation itself.</p>

<p>● A geography student is naturally inclined to create enriched notes and practice answer writing during note making and the classroom program itself.</p>

<p>● With a habit of drawing maps, diagrams, flowcharts, data visualization etc the learning curve is swift.</p>
