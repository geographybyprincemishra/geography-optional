      <i><p align="left">The Word ‘Bhoogol’(geography) in the ancient Indian literature signifies the spherical shape of the earth.</p>
       
    <p>According to Britannica, Geography seeks to answer the questions of why things are as they are, where they are. This intriguing nature of the discipline makes it one of the most compelling, engaging and preferred choices in the list of optional subjects provided by UPSC. </p>
    <p>The scientific nature of Geography particularly attracts a large crowd of aspirants who are from science background or are logically driven. This is the reason that there is a plethora of study material loosely available in the market and aspirants tend to buy a huge amount of it, ending up majorly confused and unclear which largely impacts their preparation. </p>
    <p>For that reason even though Geography is one of the most scoring optional subjects in the history of UPSC and has yielded numerous toppers in the past years, immense care has to be taken while designing a strategy on how to go about it. </p>
    <p>While different toppers have resorted to different strategies for the subject, a guided preparation is ideal for a candidate to get a head start in their journey. This would help the candidate in canceling out unnecessary sources which could have deviated their minds and consumed a huge amount of their time. </p>
    <p>Geography by Prince Mishra is an attempt in the same direction. The idea is to make things simple for the candidates and save them time which they can dedicate in strengthening their weak areas</p>
       <p>
       Mr. Prince Mishra is a noted and celebrated UPSC faculty who specializes in Geography optional and has spent more than seven years in training civil servants in the discipline of Geography. </p>
       <p>His pedagogy rests on his in-depth knowledge of the subject and teaching complex geography concepts in an easy to understand manner. He focuses on inculcating geographical perspective amongst students through teaching and discussion of previous years’ questions of IAS mains and interlinkages of different physical and human geography topics. </p>
       <p>This mixed with his own experience with the UPSC will not only help students in building an approach about prioritizing important topics over unimportant ones but also develop a foolproof strategy over time.
